# QTL_agri


## Does the confidence interval capture ARNT
- Which model is used to id peaks and what is the confid interval at 8 and other chromosomes.
  - Hailey Knott and Expectation Maximization are used
- Put into CIs, QTLs, and CIs into table and incorporate confidence interval and gene name on each plot.
  - Have intervals (in CM) but also have interval markers


- Have a phenotype effect plot without interacting loci availible
  - Find old xy scatter phenotype plots


- What are genotypes of indiv hets for AIP? Plot and box them. Include a right axis (colored with the proportion line) behind clusters
  - Also check out the resistant indiv- get genos for other QTL
  - Do the phenotype plots for each QTL*POP
  - Each panel is a QTL
- Deposit main text figs



plot


google parnter mprogram at unh




- plot phenotypes and finish all main figures
  - what are the genotypes of non-aip/ahr individuals (at other QTL)
  - need to plot AHR location on qtl peaks (use the ggplot approach as before?)
- check the 2-locus interactions on all 4 populations
